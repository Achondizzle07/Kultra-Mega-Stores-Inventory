Question 11: Was Shipping Cost Appropriately Spent Based on Order Priority?
Let‚Äôs evaluate the logic:

Order Priority	Shipping Method	Total Shipping Cost (‚Çπ)
Critical	
Delivery Truck	‚Çπ10,784
Regular Air	‚Çπ8,587
Express Air	‚Çπ1,742

High
Delivery Truck	‚Çπ11,207
Regular Air	‚Çπ10,005
Express Air	‚Çπ1,454

Low	
Delivery Truck	‚Çπ11,132
Regular Air	‚Çπ10,264
Express Air	‚Çπ1,552

Medium	
Delivery Truck	‚Çπ9,462
Regular Air	‚Çπ9,419
Express Air	‚Çπ1,634

Not Specified	
Regular Air	‚Çπ9,734
Delivery Truck	‚Çπ9,388
Express Air	‚Çπ1,470

Interpretation:
Critical orders were mostly shipped via Delivery Truck and Regular Air, with very little Express Air use.

Express Air, the most expensive method, was least used, even for critical/high priority ‚Äî which is cost-efficient, but potentially risky for delays.

Delivery Truck, the most used and most expensive cumulatively, was heavily used even for Low and Medium priority.

Conclusion:
Shipping cost does not align well with order priority:

High-priority orders should use Express Air more, despite the cost.

Low-priority orders still incurred high delivery truck costs ‚Äî an inefficiency.

Recommendation:
Recalibrate shipping policy to ensure:

- Express Air for Critical/High priority orders when speed is essential.

- Delivery Truck/Regular Air reserved for Low/Medium orders to minimize cost
